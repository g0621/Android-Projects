> The theme is little childish
> because i did't get much time to polish it
> used basic *RelativeView* and *Drawable* resource (*Available [Here](https://github.com/g0621/Android-Projects/tree/master/Echo_Music_Player/app/src/main/res)* .)
> I will redesign the UI in next build because
> I am still going through material design documentation .

### Technology Used

In-Touch uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [WaveInApp](https://github.com/Cleveroad/WaveInApp) - A free visualizer library.
* [Circular Image view](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView) - Library to make Circular Image view Backward compatible.
* [View Animator](https://github.com/florent37/ViewAnimator) - Animation library .

And of course now Echo  itself is open source so can be used as base for more complex Music Player Apps, Hope soo :) lol just kidding again.

### Installation

In-Touch requires [SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platforms.html) v26.0.2 to compile but use can change App level gradel file to compile with other SDK versions .

Install the dependencies, Sync the project and Hit the run button.



```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/g0621/Android-Projects/archive/master.zip
$ unzip Android-Projects.zip
$ cd Echo_Music_Player
```

**NOTE :**  SongPlaying fragment is little messy but it will comment it properly in next commit .
